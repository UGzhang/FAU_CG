Z fighting is the result of inaccurate test depth, and if the distance between the near plane and the far plane of the camera is large, (the depth cache cannot tell who comes first and who comes behind) will make an error. This makes it difficult to make a subtle depth distinction between the two points. If the depth values of two objects drawn before and after a pixel are very similar, this random comparison will be produced.
