Flat Schading: 
  There is no normal vector at the vertices of the triangle, but only the normal vectors on the entire surface of the triangle. 
  When lighting, the entire triangle only presents one color, so if the position of the highlight is at the vertex of the triangle, the highlight cannot be displayed.
  
Phong Shading:  
  Each vertex of the triangle has its own normal vector. The normal vector of each point in the surface is calculated according to the normal vector interpolation of the point, 
  and then the illumination value is calculated pixel by pixel, which ensures that the details can be preserved.
